take any interest in monitoring the
behavior of corporate managers.
But the latest epidemic of scandal—allegations of managerial mis-
behavior, shady accounting, or tax maneuvers at major firms like AOL,Enron, Global Crossing, Sprint, Tyco, and WorldCom—is a stark
reminder that Graham’s earlier warnings about the need for eternalvigilance are more vital than ever. Let’s bring them back and discuss
them in light of today’s events.
THEORY VERSUS PRACTICE
Graham begins his original (1949) discussion of “The Investor as Busi-
ness Owner” by pointing out that, in theory, “the stockholders as a class
are king. Acting as a majority they can hire and fire managements andbend them completely to their will. ” But, in practice, says Graham,
497the shareholders are a complete washout. As a class they show nei-
ther intelligence nor alertness. They vote in sheeplike fashion for
whatever the management recommends and no matter how poor the
management’s record of accomplishment may be. ...T h e  only way to
inspire the average American shareholder to take any independently
intelligent action would be by exploding a firecracker under him. . . .
We cannot resist pointing out the paradoxical fact that Jesus seems
to have been a more practical businessman than are American share-holders.

Graham wants you to realize something basic but incredibly pro-
found: When you buy a stock, you become an owner of the company.
Its managers, all the way up to the CEO, work for you. Its board ofdirectors must answer to you. Its cash belongs to you. Its businessesare your property. If you don’t like how your company is being man-
aged, you have the right to demand that the managers be fired, the
directors be changed, or the property be sold. “Stockholders, ”declares Graham, “should wake up. ”
2498 Commentary on Chapter 19
1Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (Harper & Row, New York,
1949), pp. 217 , 219, 240. Graham explains his reference to Jesus this way:
“In at least four parables in the Gospels there is reference to a highly critical
relationship between a man of wealth and those he puts in charge of hisproperty. Most to the point are the words that “a certain rich man” speaks to
his steward or manager, who is accused of wasting his goods: ‘Give an
account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward. ’ ( Luke,
16:2). ” Among the other parables Graham seems to have in mind is Matt.,
25:15–28.
2Benjamin Graham, “A Questionnaire on Stockholder-Management Rela-
tionship, ” The Analysts Journal, Fourth Quarter, 1947 , p. 62. Graham points
out that he had conducted a survey of nearly 600 professional security ana-lysts and found that more than 95% of them believed that shareholders havethe right to call for a formal investigation of managers whose leadershipdoes not enhance the value of the stock. Graham adds dryly that “suchaction is almost unheard of in practice. ” This, he says, “highlights the widegulf between what should happen and what does happen in shareholder-management relationships. ”THE INTELLIGENT OWNER
Today’s investors have forgotten Graham’s message. They put most of
their effort into buying a stock, a little into selling it—but none into own-ing it. “Certainly, ” Graham reminds us, “there is just as much reason toexercise care and judgment in being as in becoming a stockholder. ”
3
So how should you, as an intelligent investor, go about being an
intelligent owner? Graham starts by telling us that “there are just twobasic questions to which stockholders should turn their attention:
1. Is the management reasonably efficient?2. Are the interests of the average outside shareholder receiving
proper recognition?”
4
You should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each
company’s profitability, size, and competitiveness against similar firmsin its industry. What if you conclude that the managers are no good?
Then, urges Graham,
A few of the more substantial stockholders should become convinced
that a change is needed and should be willing to work toward that
end. Second, the rank and file of the stockholders should be open-minded enough to read the proxy material and to weigh the argu-
ments on both sides. They must at least be able to know when their
company has been unsuccessful and be ready to demand more thanartful platitudes as a vindication of the incumbent management. Third,
it would be most helpful, when the figures clearly show that the
results are well below average, if it became the custom to call in out-side business engineers to pass upon the policies and competence
of the management.

to authorize an independent committee of outside shareholders to select
“the engineering firm” that would submit its report to the shareholders, notto the board of directors. However, the company would bear the costs ofthis project. Among the kinds of “engineering firms” (cont’d on p. 501)500 Commentary on Chapter 19
THE ENRON END-RUN
Back in 1999, Enron Corp. ranked seventh on the Fortune 500
list of America’s top companies. The energy giant’s revenues,
assets, and earnings were all rising like rockets.
But what if an investor had ignored the glamour and glittering
numbers—and had simply put Enron’s 1999 proxy statementunder the microscope of common sense? Under the heading“Certain Transactions, ” the proxy disclosed that Enron’s chieffinancial officer, Andrew Fastow, was the “managing member”of two partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, that bought “energy and
communications related investments. ” And where was LJM1
and LJM2 buying from? Why, where else but from Enron! Theproxy reported that the partnerships had already bought $170
million of assets from Enron—sometimes using money borrowed
from Enron.
The intelligent investor would immediately have asked:
• Did Enron’s directors approve this arrangement? (Yes, said
the proxy.)
• Would Fastow get a piece of LJM’s profits? (Yes, said the
proxy.)
• As Enron’s chief financial officer, was Fastow obligated to act
exclusively in the interests of Enron’s shareholders? (Ofcourse.)
• Was Fastow therefore duty-bound to maximize the price
Enron obtained for any assets it sold? (Absolutely.)
• But if LJM paid a high price for Enron’s assets, would that
lower LJM’s potential profits—and Fastow’s personal
income? (Clearly.)
• On the other hand, if LJM paid a low price, would that raise
profits for Fastow and his partnerships, but hurt Enron’sincome? (Clearly.)
• Should Enron lend Fastow’s partnerships any money to buy
assets from Enron that might generate a personal profit for
Fastow? (Say what?!)
• Doesn’t all this constitute profoundly disturbing conflicts of
interest? (No other answer is even possible.)Commentary on Chapter 19 501
• What does this arrangement say about the judgment of the
directors who approved it? (It says you should take your
investment dollars elsewhere.)
Two clear lessons emerge from this disaster: Never dig so
deep into the numbers that you check your common sense at
the door, and always read the proxy statement before (and after)you buy a stock.
(cont’d from p. 499) Graham had in mind were money managers, rating agen-
cies and organizations of security analysts. Today, investors could choose
from among hundreds of consulting firms, restructuring advisers, and mem-
bers of entities like the Risk Management Association.
6Tabulations of voting results for 2002 by Georgeson Shareholder and
ADP’s Investor Communication Services, two leading firms that mail proxy
solicitations to investors, suggest response rates that average around 80%
to 88% (including proxies sent in by stockbrokers on behalf of their clients,which are automatically voted in favor of management unless the clients
specify otherwise). Thus the owners of between 12% and 20% of all shares
are not voting their proxies. Since individuals own only 40% of U.S. sharesby market value, and most institutional investors like pension funds andinsurance companies are legally bound to vote on proxy issues, that meansthat roughly a third of all individual investors are neglecting to vote.What is “proxy material” and why does Graham insist that you read
it? In its proxy statement, which it sends to every shareholder, a com-
pany announces the agenda for its annual meeting and disclosesdetails about the compensation and stock ownership of managersand directors, along with transactions between insiders and the com-pany. Shareholders are asked to vote on which accounting firm shouldaudit the books and who should serve on the board of directors. If youuse your common sense while reading the proxy, this document can
be like a canary in a coal mine—an early warning system signaling thatsomething is wrong. (See the Enron sidebar above.)
Yet, on average, between a third and a half of all individual investors
cannot be bothered to vote their proxies.
6Do they even read them?
Understanding and voting your proxy is as every bit as fundamentalto being an intelligent investor as following the news and voting your
conscience is to being a good citizen. It doesn’t matter whether youown 10% of a company or, with your piddling 100 shares, just1/10.000 of 1%. If you’ve never read the proxy of a stock you own,and the company goes bust, the only person you should blame is
yourself. If you do read the proxy and see things that disturb you, then:
• vote against every director to let them know you disapprove
• attend the annual meeting and speak up for your rights• find an online message board devoted to the stock (like those at
http://finance.yahoo.com) and rally other investors to join yourcause.
Graham had another idea that could benefit today’s investors:
. . . there are advantages to be gained through the selection of one or
more professional and independent directors. These should be menof wide business experience who can turn a fresh and expert eye on
the problems of the enterprise. ...T hey should submit a separate
annual report, addressed directly to the stockholders and containing
their views on the major question which concerns the owners of the
enterprise: “Is the business showing the results for the outside stock-
holder which could be expected of it under proper management? Ifnot, why—and what should be done about it?
7
One can only imagine the consternation that Graham’s proposal
would cause among the corporate cronies and golfing buddies who
constitute so many of today’s “independent” directors. (Let’s not sug-gest that it might send a shudder of fear down their spines, since most
independent directors do not appear to have a backbone.)
WHOSE MONEY IS IT, ANYWAY?
Now let’s look at Graham’s second criterion—whether management
acts in the best interests of outside investors. Managers have alwaystold shareholders that they—the managers—know best what to do with502 Commentary on Chapter 19
71949 edition, p. 224.the company’s cash. Graham saw right through this managerial
malarkey:
A company’s management may run the business well and yet not give
the outside stockholders the right results for them, because its effi-ciency is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use
of the capital. The objective of efficient operation is to produce at low
cost and to find the most profitable articles to sell. Efficient finance
requires that the stockholders’ money be working in forms most suit-able to their interest. This is a question in which management, as such,
has little interest. Actually, it almost always wants as much capital fromthe owners as it can possibly get, in order to minimize its own financial
problems. Thus the typical management will operate with more capital
than necessary, if the stockholders permit it—which they often do.
8
In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the managements of
leading technology companies took this “Daddy-Knows-Best” attitude
to new extremes. The argument went like this: Why should youdemand a dividend when we can invest that cash for you and turn itinto a rising share price? Just look at the way our stock has beengoing up—doesn’t that prove that we can turn your pennies into dollarsbetter than you can?
Incredibly, investors fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Daddy Knows
Best became such gospel that, by 1999, only 3.7% of the companiesthat first sold their stock to the public that year paid a dividend—down
from an average of 72.1% of all IPOs in the 1960s.

the total dollar amount of dividends paid by U.S. stocks has risen since the
late 1970s, even after inflation—but the number of stocks that pay a dividendhas shrunk by nearly two-thirds. See Harry DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, andDouglas J. Skinner, “Are Dividends Disappearing?

But Daddy Knows Best was nothing but bunk. While some compa-
nies put their cash to good use, many more fell into two other cate-
gories: those that simply wasted it, and those that piled it up far fasterthan they could possibly spend it.
In the first group, Priceline.com wrote off $67 million in losses in2000 after launching goofy ventures into groceries and gasoline, while
Amazon.com destroyed at least $233 million of its shareholders’wealth by “investing” in dot-bombs like Webvan and Ashford.com.
10
And the two biggest losses so far on record—JDS Uniphase’s $56 bil-lion in 2001 and AOL Time Warner’s $99 billion in 2002—occurredafter companies chose not to pay dividends but to merge with otherfirms at a time when their shares were obscenely overvalued.
11
In the second group, consider that by late 2001, Oracle Corp. had
piled up $5 billion in cash. Cisco Systems had hoarded at least $7 .5
billion. Microsoft had amassed a mountain of cash $38.2 billion high—and rising by an average of more than $2 million per hour.
12Just how
rainy a day was Bill Gates expecting, anyway?
So the anecdotal evidence clearly shows that many companiesCommentary on Chapter 19 505
10Perhaps Benjamin Franklin, who is said to have carried his coins around in
an asbestos purse so that money wouldn’t burn a hole in his pocket, could
have avoided this problem if he had been a CEO.
11A study by BusinessWeek found that from 1995 through 2001, 61% out
of more than 300 large mergers ended up destroying wealth for the share-holders of the acquiring company—a condition known as “the winner’s
curse” or “buyer’s remorse. ” And acquirers using stock rather than cash topay for the deal underperformed rival companies by 8%. (David Henry,
“Mergers: Why Most Big Deals Don’t Pay Off, ” BusinessWeek, October 14,
2002, pp. 60–70.) A similar academic study found that acquisitions of pri-
vate companies and subsidiaries of public companies lead to positive stock
returns, but that acquisitions of entire public companies generate losses for
the winning bidder’s shareholders. (Kathleen Fuller, Jeffry Netter, and MikeStegemoller, “What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell Us?” The Journal of
Finance, vol. 57 , no. 4, August, 2002, pp. 1763–1793.)
12With interest rates near record lows, such a mountain of cash produces
lousy returns if it just sits around. As Graham asserts, “So long as this sur-
plus cash remains with the company, the outside stockholder gets little ben-
efit from it” (1949 edition, p. 232). Indeed, by year-end 2002, Microsoft’scash balance had swollen to $43.4 billion—clear proof that the companycould find no good use for the cash its businesses were generating. AsGraham would say, Microsoft’s operations were efficient, but its finance no
longer was. In a step toward redressing this problem, Microsoft declared inearly 2003 that it would begin paying a regular quarterly dividend.don’t know how to turn excess cash into extra returns. What does the
statistical evidence tell us?
• Research by money managers Robert Arnott and Clifford Asness
found that when current dividends are low, future corporate earn-
ings also turn out to be low. And when current dividends are high,so are future earnings. Over 10-year periods, the average rate ofearnings growth was 3.9 points greater when dividends werehigh than when they were low.
13
• Columbia accounting professors Doron Nissim and Amir Ziv
found that companies that raise their dividend not only have betterstock returns but that “dividend increases are associated with[higher] future profitability for at least four years after the dividendchange. ”
14
In short, most managers are wrong when they say that they can put
your cash to better use than you can. Paying out a dividend does notguarantee great results, but it does improve the return of the typical
stock by yanking at least some cash out of the managers’ handsbefore they can either squander it or squirrel it away.
SELLING LOW, BUYING HIGH
What about the argument that companies can put spare cash to bet-
ter use by buying back their own shares? When a company repur-
chases some of its stock, that reduces the number of its shares
outstanding. Even if its net income stays flat, the company’s earnings506 Commentary on Chapter 19

Even researchers who disagree with the Arnott-Asness and Nissim-Ziv find-
ings on future earnings agree that dividend increases lead to higher futurestock returns; see Shlomo Benartzi, Roni Michaely, and Richard Thaler, “DoChanges in Dividends Signal the Future or the Past?” The Journal of
Finance, vol. 52, no. 3, July, 1997 , pp. 1007–1034.per share will rise, since its total earnings will be spread across fewer
shares. That, in turn, should lift the stock price. Better yet, unlike a div-idend, a buyback is tax-free to investors who don’t sell their shares.
15
Thus it increases the value of their stock without raising their tax bill.And if the shares are cheap, then spending spare cash to repurchasethem is an excellent use of the company’s capital.
16
All this is true in theory. Unfortunately, in the real world, stock buy-
backs have come to serve a purpose that can only be described as
sinister. Now that grants of stock options have become such a largepart of executive compensation, many companies—especially in high-
tech industries—must issue hundreds of millions of shares to give tothe managers who exercise those stock options.
17But that would jackCommentary on Chapter 19 507
15The tax reforms proposed by President George W. Bush in early 2003
would change the taxability of dividends, but the fate of this legislation was
not yet clear by press time.
16Historically, companies took a common-sense approach toward share
repurchases, reducing them when stock prices were high and steppingthem up when prices were low. After the stock market crash of October 19,
1987 , for example, 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next12 days alone—while only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in
the earlier part of the year, when stock prices had been much higher. See
Murali Jagannathan, Clifford P. Stephens, and Michael S. Weisbach, “Finan-cial Flexibility and the Choice Between Dividends and Stock Repurchases, ”
Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 57 , no. 3, September, 2000, p. 362.
17The stock options granted by a company to its executives and employees
give them the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares in the future at adiscounted price. That conversion of options to shares is called “exercising”
the options. The employees can then sell the shares at the current marketprice and pocket the difference as profit. Because hundreds of millions of
options may be exercised in a given year, the company must increase its
supply of shares outstanding. Then, however, the company’s total netincome would be spread across a much greater number of shares, reducing
its earnings per share. Therefore, the company typically feels compelled to
buy back other shares to cancel out the stock issued to the option holders.In 1998, 63.5% of chief financial officers admitted that counteracting thedilution from options was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFOForum, “The Buyback Track, ” Institutional Investor, July, 1998).up the number of shares outstanding and shrink earnings per share.
To counteract that dilution, the companies must turn right back aroundand repurchase millions of shares in the open market. By 2000, com-panies were spending an astounding 41.8% of their total net incometo repurchase their own shares—up from 4.8% in 1980.
18
Let’s look at Oracle Corp., the software giant. Between June 1,
1999, and May 31, 2000, Oracle issued 101 million shares of com-
mon stock to its senior executives and another 26 million to employ-ees at a cost of $484 million. Meanwhile, to keep the exercise ofearlier stock options from diluting its earnings per share, Oracle spent$5.3 billion— or 52% of its total revenues that year —to buy back 290.7
million shares of stock. Oracle issued the stock to insiders at an aver-
age price of $3.53 per share and repurchased it at an average price of
$18.26. Sell low, buy high: Is this any way to “enhance” shareholdervalue?
19
By 2002, Oracle’s stock had fallen to less than half its peak in
2000. Now that its shares were cheaper, did Oracle hasten to buyback more stock? Between June 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002, Oraclecutits repurchases to $2.8 billion, apparently because its executives
and employees exercised fewer options that year. The same sell-low,buy-high pattern is evident at dozens of other technology companies.
What’s going on here? Two surprising factors are at work:508 Commentary on Chapter 19
18One of the main factors driving this change was the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s decision, in 1982, to relax its previous restrictions
on share repurchases. See Gustavo Grullon and Roni Michaely, “Dividends,
Share Repurchases, and the Substitution Hypothesis, ” The Journal of
Finance, vol. 57 , no. 4, August, 2002, pp. 1649–1684.
19Throughout his writings, Graham insists that corporate managements
have a duty not just to make sure their stock is not undervalued, but also to
make sure it never gets overvalued. As he put it in Security Analysis (1934
ed., p. 515), “the responsibility of managements to act in the interest of their
shareholders includes the obligation to prevent—in so far as they are able—
the establishment of either absurdly high or unduly low prices for their secu-
rities. ” Thus, enhancing shareholder value doesn’t just mean making surethat the stock price does not go too low; it also means ensuring that thestock price does not go upto unjustifiable levels. If only the executives of
Internet companies had heeded Graham’s wisdom back in 1999!• Companies get a tax break when executives and employees exer-
cise stock options (which the IRS considers a “compensation
expense” to the company).20In its fiscal years from 2000 through
2002, for example, Oracle reaped $1.69 billion in tax benefits as
insiders cashed in on options. Sprint Corp. pocketed $678 millionin tax benefits as its executives and employees locked in $1.9 bil-
lion in options profits in 1999 and 2000.
• A senior executive heavily compensated with stock options has a
vested interest in favoring stock buybacks over dividends. Why?For technical reasons, options increase in value as the price fluc-
tuations of a stock grow more extreme. But dividends dampen thevolatility of a stock’s price. So, if the managers increased the divi-
dend, they would lower the value of their own stock options.
21
No wonder CEOs would much rather buy back stock than pay divi-
dends—regardless of how overvalued the shares may be or how dras-
tically that may waste the resources of the outside shareholders.Commentary on Chapter 19 509
20Incredibly, although options are considered a compensation expense on a
company’s tax returns, they are not counted as an expense on the income
statement in financial reports to shareholders. Investors can only hope that
accounting reforms will change this ludicrous practice.
21See George W. Fenn and Nellie Liang, “Corporate Payout Policy and
Managerial Stock Incentives, ” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 60, no. 1,
April, 2001, pp. 45–72. Dividends make stocks less volatile by providing astream of current income that cushions shareholders against fluctuations inmarket value. Several researchers have found that the average profitability of
companies with stock-buyback programs (but no cash dividends) is at least
twice as volatile as that of companies that pay dividends. Those more vari-able earnings will, in general, lead to bouncier share prices, making the man-agers’ stock options more valuable—by creating more opportunities whenshare prices will be temporarily high. Today, about two-thirds of executivecompensation comes in the form of options and other noncash awards;thirty years ago, at least two-thirds of compensation came as cash.KEEPING THEIR OPTIONS OPEN
Finally, drowsy investors have given their companies free rein to over-
pay executives in ways that are simply unconscionable. In 1997 , SteveJobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer Inc., returned to the companyas its “interim” chief executive officer. Already a wealthy man, Jobsinsisted on taking a cash salary of $1 per year. At year-end 1999, to
thank Jobs for serving as CEO “for the previous 2 1/2 years without
compensation, ” the board presented him with his very own Gulfstreamjet, at a cost to the company of a mere $90 million. The next month
Jobs agreed to drop “interim” from his job title, and the boardrewarded him with options on 20 million shares. (Until then, Jobs hadheld a grand total of two shares of Apple stock.)
The principle behind such option grants is to align the interests of
managers with outside investors. If you are an outside Apple share-
holder, you want its managers to be rewarded only if Apple’s stock
earns superior returns. Nothing else could possibly be fair to you and
the other owners of the company. But, as John Bogle, former chairmanof the Vanguard funds, points out, nearly all managers sellthe stock
they receive immediately after exercising their options. How coulddumping millions of shares for an instant profit possibly align theirinterests with those of the company’s loyal long-term shareholders?
In Jobs’ case, if Apple stock rises by just 5% annually through the
beginning of 2010, he will be able to cash in his options for $548.3million. In other words, even if Apple’s stock earns no better than half
the long-term average return of the overall stock market, Jobs will land
a half-a-billion dollar windfall.
22Does that align his interests with those
of Apple’s shareholders—or malign the trust that Apple’s shareholdershave placed in the board of directors?
Reading proxy statements vigilantly, the intelligent owner will vote
against any executive compensation plan that uses option grants toturn more than 3% of the company’s shares outstanding over to the
managers. And you should veto any plan that does not make option
grants contingent on a fair and enduring measure of superior results—510 Commentary on Chapter 19

of at least five years. No CEO ever deserves to make himself rich if hehas produced poor results for you.
A FINAL THOUGHT
Let’s go back to Graham’s suggestion that every company’s indepen-
dent board members should have to report to the shareholders in writ-ing on whether the business is properly managed on behalf of its true
owners. What if the independent directors also had to justify the
company’s policies on dividends and share repurchases? What if they
had to describe exactly how they determined that the company’s sen-ior management was not overpaid? And what if every investor became
an intelligent owner and actually read that report?Commentary on Chapter 19 511CHAPTER 20
“Margin of Safety” as the 
Central Concept of Investment
In the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of
mortal affairs into the single phrase, “This too will pass.”* Con-
fronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound invest-ment into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OFSAFETY. This is the thread that runs through all the preceding dis-
cussion of investment policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less
direct fashion. Let us try now, briefly, to trace that idea in a con-nected argument.
All experienced investors recognize that the margin-of-safety
concept is essential to the choice of sound bonds and preferredstocks. For example, a railroad should have earned its total fixed
charges better than five times (before income tax), taking a period
of years, for its bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. Thispast ability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the
margin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor againstloss or discomfiture in the event of some future decline in net
income. (The margin above charges may be stated in other ways—
512* “It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a
sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all
times and situations. They presented him the words: ‘ And this, too, shall
pass away. ’ How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!—
how consoling in the depths of affliction! ‘And this, too, shall pass away. ’ And
yet let us hope it is not quite true. ”—Abraham Lincoln, Address to the Wis-
consin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, September 30, 1859, in Abra-
ham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings, 1859–1865 (Library of America,
1985), vol. II, p. 101.for example, in the percentage by which revenues or profits may
decline before the balance after interest disappears—but the under-
lying idea remains the same.)
The bond investor does not expect future average earnings to
work out the same as in the past; if he were sure of that, the margin
demanded might be small. Nor does he rely to any controllingextent on his judgment as to whether future earnings will be mate-rially better or poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have
to measure his margin in terms of a carefully projected income
account, instead of emphasizing the margin shown in the past
record. Here the function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that
of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the
margin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earn-ings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investorto feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.
The margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively,
by comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of
debt. (A similar calculation may be made for a preferred-stock
issue.) If the business owes $10 million and is fairly worth $30 mil-lion, there is room for a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least
theoretically—before the bondholders will suffer loss. The amount
of this extra value, or “cushion,” above the debt may be approxi-mated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues
over a period of years. Since average stock prices are generally
related to average earning power, the margin of “enterprise value”over debt and the margin of earnings over charges will in most
cases yield similar results.
So much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-
value investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of commonstocks? Yes, but with some necessary modifications.
There are instances where a common stock may be considered
sound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a goodbond. This will occur, for example, when a company has outstand-
ing only common stock that under depression conditions is sellingfor less than the amount of bonds that could safely be issuedagainst its property and earning power.* That was the position of a“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 513
* “Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential profits or, as
he puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to earn year after yearhost of strongly financed industrial companies at the low price lev-
els of 1932–33. In such instances the investor can obtain the margin
of safety associated with a bond, plus all the chances of larger
income and principal appreciation inherent in a common stock.
(The only thing he lacks is the legal power to insist on dividendpayments “or else”—but this is a small drawback as comparedwith his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such circum-stances will supply an ideal, though infrequent, combination of
safety and profit opportunity. As a quite recent example of this con-
dition, let us mention once more National Presto Industries stock,which sold for a total enterprise value of $43 million in 1972. With
its $16 millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could
easily have supported this amount of bonds.
In the ordinary common stock, bought for investment under
normal conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning
power considerably above the going rate for bonds. In former edi-
tions we elucidated this point with the following figures:
Assume in a typical case that the earning power is 9% on the
price and that the bond rate is 4%; then the stockbuyer will have
an average annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. Some of the
excess is paid to him in the dividend rate; even though spent byhim, it enters into his overall investment result. The undistributed
balance is reinvested in the business for his account. In many cases
such reinvested earnings fail to add commensurately to the earn-ing power and value of his stock. (That is why the market has a
stubborn habit of valuing earnings disbursed in dividends more
generously than the portion retained in the business.)* But, if thepicture is viewed as a whole, there is a reasonably close connection514 The Intelligent Investor
if the business conditions prevailing during the period were to continue
unchanged” ( Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 354). Some of his lectures
make it clear that Graham intended the term to cover periods of five years or
more. You can crudely but conveniently approximate a company’s earning
power per share by taking the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock witha P/E ratio of 11 can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by11). Today “earning power” is often called “earnings yield. ”* This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on Chapter 19.between the growth of corporate surpluses through reinvested
earnings and the growth of corporate values.
Over a ten-year period the typical excess of stock earning
power over bond interest may aggregate 50% of the price paid.This figure is sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety—
which, under favorable conditions, will prevent or minimize a
loss. If such a margin is present in each of a diversified list oftwenty or more stocks, the probability of a favorable result under
“fairly normal conditions” becomes very large. That is why the
policy of investing in representative common stocks does notrequire high qualities of insight and foresight to work out success-
fully. If the purchases are made at the average level of the market
over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assur-ance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors liesin concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market,
or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more
than average risk of diminished earning power.
As we see it, the whole problem of common-stock investment
under 1972 conditions lies in the fact that “in a typical case” the
earning power is now much less than 9% on the price paid.* Let usassume that by concentrating somewhat on the low-multiplier
issues among the large companies a defensive investor may now“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 515
* Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a lecture he
gave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between the percent-
age rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate
of interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is the difference which wouldabsorb unsatisfactory developments. At the time the 1965 edition of The
Intelligent Investor was written the typical stock was selling at 11 times
earnings, giving about 9% return as against 4% on bonds. In that case youhad a margin of safety of over 100 per cent. Now [in 1972] there is no dif-
ference between the earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks,
and I say there is no margin of safety . . . you have a negative margin ofsafety on stocks . . . ” See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analy-sis” [transcript of lecture at the Northeast Missouri State University busi-ness school, March, 1972], Financial History, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.acquire equities at 12 times recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings
return of 8.33% on cost. He may obtain a dividend yield of about
4%, and he will have 4.33% of his cost reinvested in the business for
his account. On this basis, the excess of stock earning power overbond interest over a ten-year basis would still be too small to con-stitute an adequate margin of safety. For that reason we feel thatthere are real risks now even in a diversified list of sound commonstocks. The risks may be fully offset by the profit possibilities of 
the list; and indeed the investor may have no choice but to incur
them—for otherwise he may run an even greater risk of holdingonly fixed claims payable in steadily depreciating dollars. None-
theless the investor would do well to recognize, and to accept 
as philosophically as he can, that the old package of good profit 
possibilities combined with small ultimate risk is no longer available 
to him.*
However, the risk of paying too high a price for good-quality
stocks—while a real one—is not the chief hazard confronting the
average buyer of securities. Observation over many years has
taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchaseoflow-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions.
The purchasers view the current good earnings as equivalent to“earning power” and assume that prosperity is synonymous withsafety. It is in those years that bonds and preferred stocks of infe-
rior grade can be sold to the public at a price around par, because
they carry a little higher income return or a deceptively attractiveconversion privilege. It is then, also, that common stocks of
obscure companies can be floated at prices far above the tangibleinvestment, on the strength of two or three years of excellent
growth.
These securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any
admissible sense of the term. Coverage of interest charges and pre-ferred dividends must be tested over a number of years, including
preferably a period of subnormal business such as in 1970–71. The
same is ordinarily true of common-stock earnings if they are to516 The Intelligent Investor
* This paragraph—which Graham wrote in early 1972—is an uncannily pre-
cise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more detail, see thecommentary on Chapter 3.)qualify as indicators of earning power. Thus it follows that most of
the fair-weather investments, acquired at fair-weather prices, are
destined to suffer disturbing price declines when the horizon
clouds over—and often sooner than that. Nor can the investorcount with confidence on an eventual recovery—although thisdoes come about in some proportion of the cases—for he has neverhad a real safety margin to tide him through adversity.
The philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part
and in part contravenes the margin-of-safety principle. Thegrowth-stock buyer relies on an expected earning power that isgreater than the average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to
substitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating
his margin of safety. In investment theory there is no reason whycarefully estimated future earnings should be a less reliable guidethan the bare record of the past; in fact, security analysis is comingmore and more to prefer a competently executed evaluation of thefuture. Thus the growth-stock approach may supply as dependable
a margin of safety as is found in the ordinary investment—
provided the calculation of the future is conservatively made, andprovided it shows a satisfactory margin in relation to the price
paid.
The danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For
such favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices thatwill not be adequately protected by a conservative projection of
future earnings. (It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all
estimates, when they differ from past performance, must err at
least slightly on the side of understatement.) The margin of safetyis always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price,
small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price. If,
as we suggest, the average market level of most growth stocks is
too high to provide an adequate margin of safety for the buyer,then a simple technique of diversified buying in this field may not
work out satisfactorily. A special degree of foresight and judgment
will be needed, in order that wise individual selections may over-come the hazards inherent in the customary market level of suchissues as a whole.
The margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when
we apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. Wehave here, by definition, a favorable difference between price on“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 517the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. That
difference is the safety margin. It is available for absorbing the
effect of miscalculations or worse than average luck. The buyer of
bargain issues places particular emphasis on the ability of theinvestment to withstand adverse developments. For in most suchcases he has no real enthusiasm about the company’s prospects.True, if the prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer toavoid the security no matter how low the price. But the field of
undervalued issues is drawn from the many concerns—perhaps a
majority of the total—for which the future appears neither dis-tinctly promising nor distinctly unpromising. If these are bought
on a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power
need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results.The margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.
Theory of Diversification
There is a close logical connection between the concept of a
safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correla-
tive with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an
individual security may work out badly. For the margin guaranteesonly that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that
loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is
increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of theprofits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple
basis of the insurance-underwriting business.
Diversification is an established tenet of conservative invest-
ment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demon-strating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to whichdiversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-orful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets $1 ona single number, he is paid $35 profit when he wins—but the
chances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He has a “negative margin ofsafety.” In his case diversification is foolish. The more numbers he
bets on, the smaller his chance of ending with a profit. If he regu-
larly bets $1 on every number (including 0 and 00), he is certain tolose $2 on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the winner received$39 profit instead of $35. Then he would have a small but impor-tant margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,518 The Intelligent Investorthe better his chance of gain. And he could be certain of winning $2
on every spin by simply betting $1 each on all the numbers. (Inci-
dentally, the two examples given actually describe the respective
positions of the player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00.)*
A Criterion of Investment versus Speculation
Since there is no single definition of investment in general
acceptance, authorities have the right to define it pretty much asthey please. Many of them deny that there is any useful or depend-able difference between the concepts of investment and of specula-tion. We think this skepticism is unnecessary and harmful. It isinjurious because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning ofmany people toward the excitement and hazards of stock-marketspeculation. We suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be
used to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment
operation from a speculative one.
Probably most speculators believe they have the odds in their
favor when they take their chances, and therefore they may layclaim to a safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feel-ing that the time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill issuperior to the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustwor-thy. But such claims are unconvincing. They rest on subjectivejudgment, unsupported by any body of favorable evidence or any“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 519
* In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with numbers
1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a maximum payout 
of 35 to 1. What if you bet $1 on every number? Since only one slot can 
be the one into which the ball drops, you would win $35 on that slot, butlose $1 on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of $2. That $2 differ-
ence (or a 5.26% spread on your total $38 bet) is the casino’s “house
advantage, ” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will always lose more
than they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s interest to bet as seldom as
possible, it is in the casino’s interest to keep the roulette wheel spinning.
Likewise, the intelligent investor should seek to maximize the number ofholdings that offer “a better chance for profit than for loss. ” For mostinvestors, diversification is the simplest and cheapest way to widen yourmargin of safety.conclusive line of reasoning. We greatly doubt whether the man
who stakes money on his view that the market is heading up or
down can ever be said to be protected by a margin of safety in any
useful sense of the phrase.
By contrast, the investor’s concept of the margin of safety—as
developed earlier in this chapter—rests upon simple and definitearithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that itis well supported by practical investment experience. There is no
guarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will con-
tinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions ofthe future. But, equally, there is no valid reason for pessimism on
this score.
Thus, in sum, we say that to have a true investment there must
be present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety is
one that can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning,and by reference to a body of actual experience.
Extension of the Concept of Investment
To complete our discussion of the margin-of-safety principle we
must now make a further distinction between conventional and
unconventional investments. Conventional investments are appro-
priate for the typical portfolio. Under this heading have alwayscome United States government issues and high-grade, dividend-
paying common stocks. We have added state and municipal bonds
for those who will benefit sufficiently by their tax-exempt features.Also included are first-quality corporate bonds when, as now, they
can be bought to yield sufficiently more than United States savings
bonds.
Unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for
the enterprising investor. They cover a wide range. The broadestcategory is that of undervalued common stocks of secondary com-panies, which we recommend for purchase when they can be
bought at two-thirds or less of their indicated value. Besides these,
there is often a wide choice of medium-grade corporate bonds andpreferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices asto be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparentvalue. In these cases the average investor would be inclined to callthe securities speculative, because in his mind their lack of a first-quality rating is synonymous with a lack of investment merit.520 The Intelligent InvestorIt is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a secu-
rity of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—
provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he
practices adequate diversification. For, if the price is low enough tocreate a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets ourcriterion of investment. Our favorite supporting illustration istaken from the field of real-estate bonds. In the 1920s, billions ofdollars’ worth of these issues were sold at par and widely recom-
mended as sound investments. A large proportion had so little
margin of value over debt as to be in fact highly speculative incharacter. In the depression of the 1930s an enormous quantity of
these bonds defaulted their interest, and their price collapsed—in
some cases below 10 cents on the dollar. At that stage the sameadvisers who had recommended them at par as safe investmentswere rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and unattrac-tive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of about 90%made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and reason-
ably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times
the market quotation.*
The fact that the purchase of these bonds actually resulted in
what is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not preventthem from having true investment qualities at their low prices. The“speculative” profit was the purchaser’s reward for having made
an unusually shrewd investment. They could properly be called
investment opportunities, since a careful analysis would have
shown that the excess of value over price provided a large marginof safety. Thus the very class of “fair-weather investments” whichwe stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naïve securitybuyers is likely to afford many sound profit opportunities to the
sophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his
own price.†“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 521
* Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock; there
are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best companybecomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the worst com-pany is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.† The very people who considered technology and telecommunicationsstocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were hellishlyoverpriced, shunned them as “too risky” in 2002—even (cont’d on p. 522)The whole field of “special situations” would come under our
definition of investment operations, because the purchase is
always predicated on a thoroughgoing analysis that promises a
larger realization than the price paid. Again there are risk factors ineach individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculationsand absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.
To carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest
that a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying
such intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-
stock option warrants” selling at historically low prices. (Thisexample is intended as somewhat of a shocker.)* The entire value
of these warrants rests on the possibility that the related stocks
may some day advance above the option price. At the momentthey have no exercisable value. Yet, since all investment rests onreasonable future expectations, it is proper to view these warrantsin terms of the mathematical chances that some future bull marketwill create a large increase in their indicated value and in their
price. Such a study might well yield the conclusion that there is
much more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost andthat the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of
an ultimate loss. If that is so, there is a safety margin present even522 The Intelligent Investor
(cont’d from p. 521) though, in Graham’s exact words from an earlier
period, “the price depreciation of about 90% made many of these securities
exceedingly attractive and reasonably safe. ” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts
have always tended to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, andto label it a “sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Gra-
ham (and simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the
book, Graham is distinguishing speculation—or buying on the hope that astock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis of
what the underlying business is worth.
* Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for “warrant, ”a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder a right to pur-chase the company’s stock at a predetermined price. Warrants have beenalmost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham quips that he intendsthe example as a “shocker” because, even in his day, warrants wereregarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters. (See the commentaryon Chapter 16.)in this unprepossessing security form. A sufficiently enterprising
investor could then include an option-warrant operation in his
miscellany of unconventional investments.1
To Sum Up
Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is
amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate inWall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles
through which they have gained success in their own undertak-ings. Yet every corporate security may best be viewed, in the first
instance, as an ownership interest in, or a claim against, a specificbusiness enterprise. And if a person sets out to make profits fromsecurity purchases and sales, he is embarking on a business ven-ture of his own, which must be run in accordance with acceptedbusiness principles if it is to have a chance of success.
The first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what
you are doing—know your business.” For the investor this means:
Do not try to make “business profits” out of securities—that is,returns in excess of normal interest and dividend income—unless
you know as much about security values as you would need to
know about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu-facture or deal in.
A second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your
business, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with ade-quate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong rea-
sons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For
the investor this rule should determine the conditions under whichhe will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.
A third business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—
that is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable cal-culation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.
In particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to
gain and much to lose.” For the enterprising investor this meansthat his operations for profit should be based not on optimism buton arithmetic. For every investor it means that when he limits hisreturn to a small figure—as formerly, at least, in a conventionalbond or preferred stock—he must demand convincing evidencethat he is not risking a substantial part of his principal.“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 523A fourth business rule is more positive: “Have the courage of
your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion
from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—
even though others may hesitate or differ.” (You are neither rightnor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are rightbecause your data and reasoning are right.) Similarly, in the worldof securities, courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate
knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand.
Fortunately for the typical investor, it is by no means necessary
for his success that he bring these qualities to bear upon his pro-gram— provided he limits his ambition to his capacity and confines
his activities within the safe and narrow path of standard, defen-sive investment. To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier
than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it
looks.524 The Intelligent InvestorCOMMENTARY ON C HAPTER 20

FIRST, DON’T LOSE
What is risk?
You’ll get different answers depending on whom, and when, you
ask. In 1999, risk didn’t mean losing money; it meant making less
money than someone else. What many people feared was bumping
into somebody at a barbecue who was getting even richer even
quicker by day trading dot-com stocks than they were. Then, quitesuddenly, by 2003 risk had come to mean that the stock market might
keep dropping until it wiped out whatever traces of wealth you still had
left.
While its meaning may seem nearly as fickle and fluctuating as the
financial markets themselves, risk has some profound and permanentattributes. The people who take the biggest gambles and make thebiggest gains in a bull market are almost always the ones who get hurt
the worst in the bear market that inevitably follows. (Being “right”
makes speculators even more eager to take extra risk, as their confi-dence catches fire.) And once you lose big money, you then have to
gamble even harder just to get back to where you were, like a race-track or casino gambler who desperately doubles up after every badbet. Unless you are phenomenally lucky, that’s a recipe for disaster.No wonder, when he was asked to sum up everything he had learnedin his long career about how to get rich, the legendary financier J. K.
525Klingenstein of Wertheim & Co. answered simply: “Don’t lose. ”1This
graph shows what he meant:526 Commentary on Chapter 20

Imagine that you find a stock that you think can grow at 10% a year even if
the market only grows 5% annually. Unfortunately, you are so enthusiastic
that you pay too high a price, and the stock loses 50% of its value the first
year. Even if the stock then generates double the market’s return, it willtake you more than 16 years to overtake the market—simply because you
paid too much, and lost too much, at the outset.
Losing some money is an inevitable part of investing, and there’s noth-
ing you can do to prevent it. But, to be an intelligent investor, you must
take responsibility for ensuring that you never lose most or all of your
money. The Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, is often portrayed stand-ing on tiptoe, ready to dart away in the blink of an eye. To keep her sym-bolically in place, some of Lakshmi’s devotees will lash her statue down
with strips of fabric or nail its feet to the floor. For the intelligent investor,Graham’s “margin of safety” performs the same function: By refusing topay too much for an investment, you minimize the chances that yourwealth will ever disappear or suddenly be destroyed.
Consider this: Over the four quarters ending in December 1999,
JDS Uniphase Corp., the fiber-optics company, generated $673 mil-lion in net sales, on which it lost $313 million. Its tangible assets
totaled $1.5 billion. Yet, on March 7 , 2000, JDS Uniphase’s stock hit$153 a share, giving the company a total market value of roughly
$143 billion.
2And then, like most “New Era” stocks, it crashed. Any-
one who bought it that day and still clung to it at the end of 2002
faced these prospects:Commentary on Chapter 20 527

THE RISK IS NOT IN OUR STOCKS, 
BUT IN OURSELVES
Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate 
how well you really understand an investment, or overstate your abilityto ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you
own or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in
what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you
are. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroomand step up to the mirror. That’s risk, gazing back at you from the
glass.
As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for?
The Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains twofactors that characterize good decisions:
•“well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as
well as I think I do?)
•“correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis
turns out to be wrong?).
To find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the
mirror and ask yourself: “What is the likelihood that my analysis is
right?” Think carefully through these questions:
• How much experience do I have? What is my track record with
similar decisions in the past?
• What is the typical track record of other people who have tried
this in the past?
3
• If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?
• If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?528 Commentary on Chapter 20
3No one who diligently researched the answer to this question, and hon-
estly accepted the results, would ever have day traded or bought IPOs.• Have I calculated how much this investment needs to go up for
me to break even after my taxes and costs of trading?
Next, look in the mirror to find out whether you are the kind of per-
son who correctly anticipates your regret. Start by asking: “Do I fully
understand the consequences if my analysis turns out to be wrong?”Answer that question by considering these points:
• If I’m right, I could make a lot of money. But what if I’m wrong?
Based on the historical performance of similar investments, how
much could I lose?
• Do I have other investments that will tide me over if this decision
turns out to be wrong? Do I already hold stocks, bonds, or fundswith a proven record of going up when the kind of investment I’m
considering goes down? Am I putting too much of my capital at
risk with this new investment?
• When I tell myself, “You have a high tolerance for risk, ” how do I
know? Have I ever lost a lot of money on an investment? How didit feel? Did I buy more, or did I bail out?
• Am I relying on my willpower alone to prevent me from panicking
at the wrong time? Or have I controlled my own behavior inadvance by diversifying, signing an investment contract, and dol-
lar-cost averaging?
You should always remember, in the words of the psychologist Paul
Slovic, that “risk is brewed from an equal dose of two ingredients—
probabilities and consequences. ”
4Before you invest, you must ensure
that you have realistically assessed your probability of being right and
how you will react to the consequences of being wrong.
PASCAL’S WAGER
The investment philosopher Peter Bernstein has another way of sum-
ming this up. He reaches back to Blaise Pascal, the great French
mathematician and theologian (1623–1662), who created a thoughtCommentary on Chapter 20 529
4Paul Slovic, “Informing and Educating the Public about Risk, ” Risk Analy-
sis,vol. 6, no. 4 (1986), p. 412.experiment in which an agnostic must gamble on whether or not God
exists. The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conductin this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in theafterlife. In this wager, Pascal asserts, “reason cannot decide” theprobability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and
only faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the proba-bilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are per-
fectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:
Suppose you act as though God is and [you] lead a life of virtue and
abstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed upsome goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose
you act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and
lust when in fact God is. You may have had fun and thrills during therelatively brief duration of your lifetime, but when the day of judgment
rolls around you are in big trouble.

Concludes Bernstein: “In making decisions under conditions of
uncertainty, the consequences must dominate the probabilities. We
never know the future. ” Thus, as Graham has reminded you in everychapter of this book, the intelligent investor must focus not just on get-
ting the analysis right. You must also ensure against loss if your analy-sis turns out to be wrong—as even the best analyses will be at leastsome of the time. The probability of making at least one mistake atsome point in your investing lifetime is virtually 100%, and those odds
are entirely out of your control. However, you dohave control over the
consequences of being wrong. Many “investors” put essentially all of
their money into dot-com stocks in 1999; an online survey of 1,338
Americans by Money Magazine in 1999 found that nearly one-tenth of
them had at least 85% of their money in Internet stocks. By ignoring
Graham’s call for a margin of safety, these people took the wrong side
of Pascal’s wager. Certain that they knew the probabilities of being530 Commentary on Chapter 20

We know very well two partners who spent a good part of their
lives handling their own and other people’s funds on Wall Street.
Some hard experience taught them it was better to be safe and care-
ful rather than to try to make all the money in the world. They
established a rather unique approach to security operations, whichcombined good profit possibilities with sound values. They
avoided anything that appeared overpriced and were rather too
quick to dispose of issues that had advanced to levels they deemedno longer attractive. Their portfolio was always well diversified,with more than a hundred different issues represented. In this waythey did quite well through many years of ups and downs in thegeneral market; they averaged about 20% per annum on the sev-
eral millions of capital they had accepted for management, and
their clients were well pleased with the results.*
In the year in which the first edition of this book appeared an
opportunity was offered to the partners’ fund to purchase a half-
interest in a growing enterprise. For some reason the industry did
not have Wall Street appeal at the time and the deal had been turned
down by quite a few important houses. But the pair was impressed
by the company’s possibilities; what was decisive for them was thatthe price was moderate in relation to current earnings and asset
value. The partners went ahead with the acquisition, amounting in
dollars to about one-fifth of their fund. They became closely identi-fied with the new business interest, which prospered.†
532* The two partners Graham coyly refers to are Jerome Newman and Ben-
jamin Graham himself.† Graham is describing the Government Employees Insurance Co., orGEICO, in which he and Newman purchased a 50% interest in 1948, rightIn fact it did so well that the price of its shares advanced to two
hundred times or more the price paid for the half-interest. The
advance far outstripped the actual growth in profits, and almost
from the start the quotation appeared much too high in terms ofthe partners’ own investment standards. But since they regardedthe company as a sort of “family business,” they continued tomaintain a substantial ownership of the shares despite the spectac-ular price rise. A large number of participants in their funds did the
same, and they became millionaires through their holding in this
one enterprise, plus later-organized affiliates.*
Ironically enough, the aggregate of profits accruing from this
single investment decision far exceeded the sum of all the othersrealized through 20 years of wide-ranging operations in the part-ners’ specialized fields, involving much investigation, endless pon-dering, and countless individual decisions.
Are there morals to this story of value to the intelligent investor?
An obvious one is that there are several different ways to make 
and keep money in Wall Street. Another, not so obvious, is that 
one lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision—can we tellthem apart?—may count for more than a lifetime of journeyman
efforts.

usually exist a background of preparation and disciplined capacity.One needs to be sufficiently established and recognized so that
these opportunities will knock at his particular door. One mustPostscript 533
around the time he finished writing The Intelligent Investor. The $712,500
that Graham and Newman put into GEICO was roughly 25% of their fund’s
assets at the time. Graham was a member of GEICO’s board of directors
for many years. In a nice twist of fate, Graham’s greatest student, WarrenBuffett, made an immense bet of his own on GEICO in 1976, by which time
the big insurer had slid to the brink of bankruptcy. It turned out to be one of
Buffett’s best investments as well.* Because of a legal technicality, Graham and Newman were directed by the
U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission to “spin off, ” or distribute, Graham-
Newman Corp. ’s GEICO stake to the fund’s shareholders. An investor whoowned 100 shares of Graham-Newman at the beginning of 1948 (worth$11,413) and who then held on to the GEICO distribution would have had$1.66 million by 1972. GEICO’s “later-organized affiliates” included Gov-ernment Employees Financial Corp. and Criterion Insurance Co.have the means, the judgment, and the courage to take advantage
of them.
Of course, we cannot promise a like spectacular experience to all
intelligent investors who remain both prudent and alert throughthe years. We are not going to end with J. J. Raskob’s slogan that wemade fun of at the beginning: “Everybody can be rich.” But inter-esting possibilities abound on the financial scene, and the intelli-gent and enterprising investor should be able to find both
enjoyment and profit in this three-ring circus. Excitement is guar-
anteed.534 The Intelligent InvestorCOMMENTARY ON POSTSCRIPT
Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. At first
glance, when you realize that Graham put 25% of his fund into a sin-
gle stock, you might think he was gambling rashly with his investors’money. But then, when you discover that Graham had painstakinglyestablished that he could liquidate GEICO for at least what he paidfor it, it becomes clear that Graham was taking very little financial risk.But he needed enormous courage to take the psychological risk of
such a big bet on so unknown a stock.

And today’s headlines are full of fearful facts and unresolved risks:
the death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corpo-
rate fraud, the specters of terrorism and war. “Investors don’t likeuncertainty, ” a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV or
in today’s newspaper. But investors have never liked uncertainty—and
yet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investingworld. It always has been, and it always will be. At heart, “uncertainty”
and “investing” are synonyms. In the real world, no one has ever been
given the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buystocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest at
all. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow.
The most literate of investors, Graham loved the story of Ulysses,
told through the poetry of Homer, Alfred Tennyson, and Dante. Late inhis life, Graham relished the scene in Dante’s Inferno when Ulysses
describes inspiring his crew to sail westward into the unknown waters
beyond the gates of Hercules:
5351Graham’s anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who are
not as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against the risk of
putting too much money into a single investment. When Graham himselfadmits that GEICO was a “lucky break, ” that’s a signal that most of us can-not count on being able to find such a great opportunity. To keep investingfrom decaying into gambling, you must diversify.“O brothers, ” I said, “who after a hundred thousand
perils have reached the west,
in this little waking vigil
that still remains to our senses,let us not choose to avoid the experienceof the unpeopled world that lies behind the sun.
Consider the seeds from which you sprang:
You were made not to live like beasts,but to seek virtue and understanding. ”
With this little oration I made my shipmates
so eager for the voyagethat it would have hurt to hold them back.
And we swung our stern toward the morning
and turned our oars into wings for the wild flight.

Investing, too, is an adventure; the financial future is always an
uncharted world. With Graham as your guide, your lifelong investing
voyage should be as safe and confident as it is adventurous.536 Commentary on Postscript

1. The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville
by Warren E. Buffett
EDITOR ’S NOTE :This article is an edited transcript of a talk given at
Columbia University in 1984 commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of
Security Analysis, written by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd.
This specialized volume first introduced the ideas later popularized inThe Intelligent Investor. Buffett’s essay offers a fascinating study of how
Graham’s disciples have used Graham’s value investing approach to real-
ize phenomenal success in the stock market.
Is the Graham and Dodd “look for values with a significant
margin of safety relative to prices” approach to security analysis
out of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today sayyes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock
prices reflect everything that is known about a company’s
prospects and about the state of the economy. There are no under-valued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart secu-
rity analysts who utilize all available information to ensure
unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the mar-ket year after year are just lucky. “If prices fully reflect available
information, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out,” writes
one of today’s textbook authors.
Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors
who have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at
537least worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that
these winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as
superior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fif-
teen years ago. Absent this condition—that is, if I had just recentlysearched among thousands of records to select a few names for youthis morning—I would advise you to stop reading right here. Ishould add that all these records have been audited. And I shouldfurther add that I have known many of those who have invested
with these managers, and the checks received by those participants
over the years have matched the stated records.
Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a
national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 millionAmericans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager adollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call theflip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those whocalled wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequentday the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.
After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately
220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called tenflips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.
Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up
about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-est, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive
members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what
marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.
Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards
from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who
have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who,
by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over 
$1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would
have been won.
By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will proba-
bly write books on “How I Turned a Dollar into a Million inTwenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet,they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending semi-nars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professorswith, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”
But then some business school professor will probably be 
rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans 538 Appendixeshad engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much 
the same—215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning
flips.
I would argue, however, that there aresome important differ-
ences in the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a)
you had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as theU.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if(c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you
would be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would
probably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feedingthem, whether they had special exercises, what books they read,
and who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraor-
dinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if youcould identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that mightbe causal factors.
Scientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were
trying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer—with,
say, 1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400
of them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, youwould get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of
those afflicted, or other variables. You know that it’s not random
chance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarilyknow the causal factors, but you would know where to search.
I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other
than geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can bewhat I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a dispro-
portionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment
world came from a very small intellectual village that could be
called Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that
simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu-
lar intellectual village.
Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration
unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-flipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When hecalled heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the sameway. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing.You would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Sim-ilarly, let’s assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal societyAppendixes 539and every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten
members. Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so
strong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day,
every member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now,at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, andyou would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naivetypes might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factoras an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it
would have no significance at all because it would simply mean
that you didn’t have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 ran-domly distributed families who were winners.
In this group of successful investors that I want to consider,
there has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. Butthe children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch havecalled their “flips” in very different ways. They have gone to differ-ent places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yetthey have had a combined record that simply can’t be explained by
random chance. It certainly cannot be explained by the fact that
they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling thecalls to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual
theory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has
decided on his own manner of applying the theory.
The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-
and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between thevalue of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in
the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies withoutthe efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks arebought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July,etc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just
what our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the
medium of marketable stocks—I doubt that many are crankinginto their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in
which the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any dif-
ference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or aFriday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time andeffort to see whether it makes a difference when buying smallpieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors,needless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model,or covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of540 Appendixesany interest to them. In fact, most of them would have difficulty
defining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables:
price and value.
I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of
price and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine
buying an entire business simply because the price of the businesshad been marked upsubstantially last week and the week before?
Of course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and
volume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are
almost endless data available about them. It isn’t necessarilybecause such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are
there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathemati-
cal skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills areacquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has noutility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer,everything looks like a nail.
I think the group that we have identified by a common intellec-
tual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academicstudies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, season-ality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest
has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual con-
centration of value-oriented winners.
I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of
us who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954through 1956. There were only four—I have not selected thesenames from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-
Newman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turnedme down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously!
After much pestering he finally hired me. There were three part-
ners and four of us at the “peasant” level. All four left between
1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible totrace the record of three.
The first example (see Table 1, pages 549–550) is that of Walter
Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from BenGraham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter leftGraham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown hereover 28 years.
Here is what “Adam Smith”—after I told him about Walter—
wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):Appendixes 541He has no connections or access to useful information. Practi-
cally no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas.
He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual
reports, and that’s about it.
In introducing me to [Schloss] Warren had also, to my mind,
described himself. “He never forgets that he is handling otherpeople’s money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to
loss.” He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself.Money is real to him and stocks are real—and from this flows an
attraction to the “margin of safety” principle.
Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks
currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at consider-
ably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does.
He doesn’t worry about whether it’s January, he doesn’t worry
about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an
election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and Ican buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And hedoes it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocksthan I do—and is far less interested in the underlying nature of thebusiness: I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter.
That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.
The second case is Tom Knapp, who also worked at Graham-
Newman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton beforethe war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum.
And then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a nightcourse in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit
basis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that
course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School,where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd’s course again, and
took Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom
to ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on thebeach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!
In 1968 Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple,
along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formedTweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear inTable 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversifi-cation. They occasionally bought control of businesses, but therecord of the passive investments is equal to the record of the con-trol investments.542 AppendixesTable 3 describes the third member of the group who formed
Buffett Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in
1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a contin-
uation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single indexI can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investmentmanagement at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, ithas been satisfactory.
Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed
by a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane.After getting out of Harvard Business School, he went to WallStreet. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business educa-
tion so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met
in early 1951. Bill’s record from 1951 to 1970, working with rela-tively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound upBuffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handleall our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a ter-rible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier
market and all the difficulties that made for comparative perfor-
mance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that mypartners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but
added money, with the happy result shown.
There’s no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I
recommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if heachieved a four-point-per-annum advantage over the Standard &
Poor’s, that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved wellover that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That
makes things much more difficult. Size is the anchor of perfor-mance. There is no question about it. It doesn’t mean you can’t do
better than average when you get larger, but the margin shrinks.
And if you ever get so you’re managing two trillion dollars, and
that happens to be the amount of the total equity evaluation in theeconomy, don’t think that you’ll do better than average!
I should add that in the records we’ve looked at so far, through-
out this whole period there was practically no duplication in theseportfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepan-cies between price and value, but they make their selections verydifferently. Walter’s largest holdings have been such stalwarts asHudson Pulp & Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New YorkTrap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantlyto mind to even a casual reader of the business pages. TweedyAppendixes 543Browne’s selections have sunk even well below that level in terms
of name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big
companies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very
low. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fiftypeople yelling out the same thing after him.
Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law
graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better.
He set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfo-
lio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his recordwas much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-
from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and
valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whosewhole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown.Incidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner for a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he ran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost
completely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned
earlier.
Table 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie
Munger’s—another non–business school type—who was a mathmajor at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and wasan IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to
him. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965
to 1983, against a compounded gain of 316 percent for the S&P ,came off with 22,200 percent, which, probably because he lacks a
business school education, he regards as statistically significant.
One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buy-
ing dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately with people or itdoesn’t take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a per-
son right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and showhim records, and it doesn’t make any difference. They just don’t
seem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick
Guerin, who had no formal education in business, understandsimmediately the value approach to investing and he’s applying itfive minutes later. I’ve never seen anyone who became a gradualconvert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn’t seem tobe a matter of IQ or academic training. It’s instant recognition, or itis nothing.544 AppendixesTable 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts
major at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the
advertising agency of Bozell & Jacobs. We happened to be in the
same building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better busi-ness than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutesfor Stan to embrace the value approach.
Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not
own what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently.
But every time Perlmeter buys a stock it’s because he’s gettingmore for his money than he’s paying. That’s the only thing he’sthinking about. He’s not looking at quarterly earnings projections,
he’s not looking at next year’s earnings, he’s not thinking about
what day of the week it is, he doesn’t care what investmentresearch from any place says, he’s not interested in price momen-tum, volume, or anything. He’s simply asking: What is the busi-ness worth?
Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been
involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds withwhich I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influ-enced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented man-
agers. Very, very few pension funds are managed from a value
standpoint. Table 8 is the Washington Post Company’s PensionFund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that
they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.
As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever
since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at
least 25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not havebeen necessarily the choice of these managers. So I’ve included thebond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no par-
ticular expertise about bonds. They wouldn’t have said they did.
Even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that wasnot their game, they were in the top percentile of fund manage-
ment. The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly
long period but it does represent many investment decisions bythree managers who were not identified retroactively.
Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t man-
age a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision toselect value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selectedmanagers much the same way as most larger companies. They nowAppendixes 545rank number one in the Becker survey of pension funds for their
size over the period of time subsequent to this “conversion” to the
value approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any
duration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative recordbetter than the S&P . All eight had a better record last year than theS&P . The net difference now between a median performance andthe actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the
selection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I
would necessarily select but they have the common denominatorof selecting securities based on value.
So these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-
Doddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from amongthousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch oflottery winners—people I had never heard of before they won thelottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their frameworkfor investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught
and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect,
character, and temperament. It’s very important to understand thatthis group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record
in years when the general market was weak. While they differ
greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the
business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole
businesses. Far more often they simply buy small pieces of busi-nesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi-ness, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of
stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the differ-ence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.
I’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market.
These Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully ex-
ploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stockcan be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the
margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or
the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the marketalways prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently non-sensical.
I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward.
Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. Ifsomeone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have546 Appendixesslipped one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it
once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline—
perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer
me $5 million to pull the trigger twice—now that would be a posi-tive correlation between risk and reward!
The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dol-
lar bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case.
The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less
risk there is.
One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was
selling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, youcould have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than$400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned thePost, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets.
Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person whowould have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.
Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made
the valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta wouldhave been greater. And to people who think beta measures risk, the
cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in
Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier tobuy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 mil-
lion. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities
and you know anything at all about business valuation, there isessentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particu-
larly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles for $8 million each.Since you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to
be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people,
but that’s not a difficult job.
You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a
very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses.But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by
having a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth$83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous mar-gin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000pounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound trucks across it. And thatsame principle works in investing.
In conclusion, some of the more commercially minded amongAppendixes 547you may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many con-
verts to the value approach will perforce narrow the spreads
between price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been
out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wroteSecurity Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing
in the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some per-verse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from
the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s likely to
continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the FlatEarth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrep-
ancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who
read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.

1975 37.22. Important Rules Concerning Taxability of Investment
Income and Security Transactions (in 1972)
Editor’s note: Due to extensive changes in the rules governing such
transactions, the following document is presented here for historicalpurposes only. When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the
information therein was correct. However, intervening developments
have rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Follow-
ing Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of“The Basics of Investment Taxation, ” which brings the reader up-to-
date on the relevant rules.
Rule 1—Interest and Dividends
Interest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)
income received from state, municipal, and similar obligations,
which are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b)dividends representing a return of capital, (c) certain dividends
paid by investment companies (see below), and (d) the first $100 of
ordinary domestic-corporation dividends.
Rule 2—Capital Gains and Losses
Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net
short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and lossesare merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If thenet short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss,
100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maxi-
mum tax thereon is 25% up to $50,000 of such gains and 35% on thebalance.
A net capital loss (the amount exceeding capital gains) is
deductible from ordinary income to a maximum of $1,000 in thecurrent year and in each of the next five years. Alternatively,
unused losses may be applied at any time to offset capital gains.
(Carry-overs of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberallythan later losses.)
Note Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”
Most investment funds (“investment companies”) take advan-
tage of special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to beAppendixes 561taxed substantially as partnerships. Thus if they make long-term
security profits they can distribute these as “capital-gain divi-
dends,” which are reported by their shareholders in the same way
as long-term gains. These carry a lower tax rate than ordinary divi-dends. Alternatively, such a company may elect to pay the 25% taxfor the account of its shareholders and then retain the balance ofthe capital gains without distributing them as capital-gain divi-dends.
3. The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)
Interest and Dividends
Interest and dividends are taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate
except (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from
Federal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends rep-
resenting a return of capital, and (c) long-term capital-gain distribu-tions paid by mutual funds (see below). Private-activity municipal
bonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the Federal alter-native minimum tax.
Capital Gains and Losses
Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short-
term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses aremerged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net
short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, thatexcess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term capi-
tal gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally 20%—
which will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,2000, and held for more than five years.
A net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim-
um of $3,000 in the current year. Any capital losses in excess of$3,000 may be applied in later tax years to offset future capital 
gains.
Mutual Funds
As “regulated investment companies, ” nearly all mutual funds take
advantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from562 Appendixescorporate income tax. After selling long-term holdings, mutual funds
can distribute the profits as “capital-gain dividends, ” which their share-holders treat as long-term gains. These are taxed at a lower rate (gen-erally 20%) than ordinary dividends (up to 39%). You should generallyavoid making large new investments during the fourth quarter of each
year, when these capital-gain distributions are usually distributed; oth-erwise you will incur tax for a gain earned by the fund before you even
owned it.
4. The New Speculation in Common Stocks1
What I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years
in Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has
included the recurrent advent of new conditions, or a new atmo-sphere, which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true thatone of the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and secu-rity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid-ity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we
have no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least
studied and understood them. My address today is an efforttoward such understanding in a limited field—in particular, an
endeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the
present and the past in our underlying attitudes toward invest-ment and speculation in common stocks.
Let me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the specu-
lative elements of a common stock resided almost exclusively inthe company itself; they were due to uncertainties, or fluctuating
elements, or downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corpora-
tion’s individual setup. These elements of speculation still exist, ofcourse; but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished
by a number of long-term developments to which I shall refer. But
in revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro-duced into the common-stock arena from outside the companies. It
comes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying publicand their advisers—chiefly us security analysts. This attitude maybe described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future expecta-tions.
Nothing will appear more logical and natural to this audience
than the idea that a common stock should be valued and pricedAppendixes 563primarily on the basis of the company’s expected future perfor-
mance. Yet this simple-appearing concept carries with it a number
of paradoxes and pitfalls. For one thing, it obliterates a good part of
the older, well-established distinctions between investment andspeculation. The dictionary says that “speculate” comes from theLatin “specula,” a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who lookedout and saw future developments coming before other people did.But today, if the investor is shrewd or well advised, he too must
have his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common
lookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.
Secondly, we find that, for the most part, companies with the
best investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are theones which are likely to attract the largest speculative interest intheir common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteeda brilliant future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-ticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the applicationof formulas out of higher mathematics to establish the present
value of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu-
las with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, orrather to justify, practically any value one wishes, however high,
for a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on
close examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-sonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and
maintain itself for a given growth company; hence at times the
market may conceivably value the growth component at a strik-ingly lowfigure.
Returning to my distinction between the older and newer spec-
ulative elements in common stock, we might characterize them bytwo outlandish but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exoge-
nous. Let me illustrate briefly the old-time speculative common
stock, as distinguished from an investment stock, by some datarelating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1911–1913.
(These appear in Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, Security
Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)
In those three years the price range of “Pennsy” moved only
between 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn-
ings for the period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable$3 dividend, and investors were sure that it was backed by wellover its par of $50 in tangible assets. By contrast, the price of Amer-564 Appendixesican Can ranged between 9 and 47; its earnings between 7 cents
and $8.86; the ratio of price to the three-year average earnings
moved between 1.9 times and 10 times; it paid no dividend at all;
and sophisticated investors were well aware that the $100 parvalue of the common represented nothing but undisclosed“water,” since the preferred issue exceeded the tangible assetsavailable for it. Thus American Can common was a representativespeculative issue, because American Can Company was then a
speculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain
industry. Actually, American Can had a far more brilliant long-term future than Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact
not suspected by investors or speculators in those days, but even if
it had been it would probably have been put aside by the investorsas basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in theyears 1911–1913.
Now, to expose you to the development through time of the
importance of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to
use as my example our most spectacular giant industrial enter-
prise—none other than International Business Machines, whichlast year entered the small group of companies with $1 billion of
sales. May I introduce one or two autobiographical notes here, in
order to inject a little of the personal touch into what otherwisewould be an excursion into cold figures? In 1912 I had left college
for a term to take charge of a research project for U.S. Express Com-
pany. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-lutionary new system of computing express rates. For this purpose
we used the so-called Hollerith machines, leased out by the thenComputing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card
punches, card sorters, and tabulators—tools almost unknown to
businessmen, then, and having their chief application in the Cen-
sus Bureau. I entered Wall Street in 1914, and the next year thebonds and common stock of C.-T.-R. Company were listed on the
New York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind of sentimental inter-
est in that enterprise, and besides I considered myself a sort oftechnological expert on their products, being one of the few finan-cial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I went tothe head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to himthat C.-T.-R. stock was selling in the middle 40s (for 105,000shares); that it had earned $6.50 in 1915; that its book value—Appendixes 565including, to be sure, some nonsegregated intangibles—was $130;
that it had started a $3 dividend; and that I thought rather highly of
the company’s products and prospects. Mr. A. N. looked at me
pityingly. “Ben,” said he, “do not mention that company to meagain. I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. [His favoriteexpression.] Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and theyare no good. So how can the stock be any good? Everybody knowsthere is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In those days that
was the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the asset account
of the balance sheet was fictitious. Many industrial companies—notably U.S. Steel—despite their $100 par, represented nothing but
water, concealed in a written-up plant account. Since they had
“nothing” to back them but earning power and future prospects,no self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)
I returned to my statistician’s cubbyhole, a chastened young
man. Mr. A. N. was not only experienced and successful, butextremely shrewd as well. So much was I impressed by his sweep-
ing condemnation of Computing-Tabulating-Recording that I
never bought a share of it in my life, not even after its name waschanged to International Business Machines in 1926.
Now let us take a look at the same company with its new name
in 1926, a year of pretty high stock markets. At that time it firstrevealed the good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large
sum of $13.6 million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar
of the so-called equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth-ing but water. However, since that time the company had made an
impressive record under the direction of T. L. Watson, Sr. Its nethad risen from $691,000 to $3.7 million—over fivefold—a greater
percentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent eleven-year
period. It had built up a nice tangible equity for the common, and
had split it 3.6 for one. It had established a $3 dividend rate for thenew stock, while earnings were $6.39 thereon. You might have
expected the 1926 stock market to have been pretty enthusiastic
about a company with such a growth history and so strong a tradeposition. Let us see. The price range for that year was 31 low, 59high. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multi-plier of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it haddone in 1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangiblebook value, and in that respect was far more conservatively pricedthan eleven years earlier.566 AppendixesThese data illustrate, as well as any can, the persistence of the
old-time investment viewpoint until the culminating years of the
bull market of the 1920s. What has happened since then can be
summarized by using ten-year intervals in the history of IBM. In1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures, and the average multi-plier rose from 7 to 17
1⁄2. From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 21⁄2times,
but the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 171⁄2.Then the pace
accelerated. The 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946, and theaverage multiplier rose to 32
1⁄2. Last year, with a further gain in net,
the multiplier rose again to an average of 42, if we do not count the
unconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary.
When we examine these recent price figures with care we see
some interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years
earlier. The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balancesheets of industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first bydisclosure and then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water hasbeen put back into the valuation by the stock market—by investorsand speculators themselves. When IBM now sells at 7 times itsbook value, instead of 7 times earnings, the effect is practically the
same as if it had no book value at all. Or the small book-value por-
tion can be considered as a sort of minor preferred-stock compo-nent of the price, the rest representing exactly the same sort of
commitment as the old-time speculator made when he bought
Woolworth or U.S. Steel common entirely for their earning powerand future prospects.
It is worth remarking, in passing, that in the thirty years which
saw IBM transformed from a 7-times earnings to a 40-times earn-ings enterprise, many of what I have called the endogenous specu-
lative aspects of our large industrial companies have tended to
disappear, or at least to diminish greatly. Their financial positionsare firm, their capital structures conservative: they are managed far
more expertly, and even more honestly, than before. Furthermore,
the requirements of complete disclosure have removed one of theimportant speculative elements of years ago—that derived from
ignorance and mystery.
Another personal digression here. In my early years in the Street
one of the favorite mystery stocks was Consolidated Gas of New
York, now Consolidated Edison. It owned as a subsidiary the prof-itable New York Edison Company, but it reported only dividendsreceived from this source, not its full earnings. The unreported Edi-Appendixes 567son earnings supplied the mystery and the “hidden value.” To my
surprise I discovered that these hush-hush figures were actually on
file each year with the Public Service Commission of the state. It
was a simple matter to consult the records and to present the trueearnings of Consolidated Gas in a magazine article. (Incidentally,the addition to profits was not spectacular.) One of my olderfriends said to me then: “Ben, you may think you are a great guy tosupply those missing figures, but Wall Street is going to thank you
for nothing. Consolidated Gas with the mystery is both more inter-
esting and more valuable than ex-mystery. You youngsters whowant to stick your noses into everything are going to ruin Wall
Street.”
It is true that the three M’s which then supplied so much fuel to
the speculative fires have now all but disappeared. These were
Mystery, Manipulation, and (thin) Margins. But we security ana-lysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which areso speculative in themselves as to pretty well take the place of
those older speculative factors. Do we not have our own “3M’s”
now—none other than Minnesota Mining and ManufacturingCompany—and does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the
new speculation as contrasted with the old? Consider a few fig-
ures. When M. M. & M. common sold at 101 last year the marketwas valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which happened to show
no increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself was valued at
$1.7 billion, of which $200 million was covered by net assets, and acool $1
1⁄2billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”
We do not know the process of calculation by which that valuationof good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later
the market revised this appraisal downward by some $450 million,
or about 30 per cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accu-rately the intangible component of a splendid company such as
this. It follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor-
tant the good will or future earning-power factor the more uncer-
tain becomes the true value of the enterprise, and therefore the
more speculative inherently the common stock.
It may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed
in the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare ear-lier times with today. A generation or more ago it was the standardrule, recognized both in average stock prices and in formal or legal568 Appendixesvaluations, that intangibles were to be appraised on a more conser-
vative basis than tangibles. A good industrial company might be
required to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible
assets, represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but itsexcess earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would bevalued on, say, a 15 per cent basis. (You will find approximatelythese ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-mon stock in 1911, and in numerous others.) But what has hap-
pened since the 1920s? Essentially the exact reverse of these
relationships may now be seen. A company must now typicallyearn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the
average market at full book value. But its excess earnings, above 10
per cent on capital, are usually valued more liberally, or at a highermultiplier, than the base earnings required to support the bookvalue in the market. Thus a company earning 15 per cent on theequity may well sell at 13
1⁄2times earnings, or twice its net assets.
This would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val-
ued at only 10 times, but the next 5 per cent—what used to be
called the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.
Now there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce-
dure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-tions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given theseliberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself,
and the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more
cogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand inhand with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is reallypaid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is notthe good will in the old and restricted sense of an established nameand a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec-
tations of increased profits in the future.
This brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of
the new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shalltouch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests
show, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—i.e., as the rate of return on book value increases—then the arith-metical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increasedirectly as the square of the earnings, but inversely the book value.
Thus in an important and very real sense tangible assets havebecome a drag on average market value rather than a sourceAppendixes 569thereof. Take a far from extreme illustration. If Company A earns $4
a share on a $20 book value, and Company B also $4 a share on
$100 book value, Company A is almost certain to sell at a higher
multiplier, and hence at higher price than Company B—say $60 forCompany A shares and $35 for Company B shares. Thus it wouldnot be inexact to declare that the $80 per share of greater assets forCompany B are responsible for the $25 per share lower marketprice, since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal.
But more important than the foregoing is the general relation-
ship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values.Given the three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the
rate of earnings growth, (b) a sufficiently long projection of this
growth into the future, and (c) the miraculous workings of com-pound interest—lo! the security analyst is supplied with a newkind of philosopher’s stone which can produce or justify anydesired valuation for a really “good stock.” I have commented in arecent article in the Analysts’ Journal on the vogue of higher mathe-
matics in bull markets, and quoted David Durand’s exposition ofthe striking analogy between value calculations of growth stocksand the famous Petersburg Paradox, which has challenged and
confused mathematicians for more than two hundred years. The
point I want to make here is that there is a special paradox in therelationship between mathematics and investment attitudes on
common stocks, which is this: Mathematics is ordinarily consid-
ered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stockmarket the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more
uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.In forty-four years of Wall Street experience and study I have never
seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or
related investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or
the most elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra, you could take it as a warning signal that the
operator was trying to substitute theory for experience, and usu-
ally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment.
The older ideas of common-stock investment may seem quite
naïve to the sophisticated security analyst of today. The greatemphasis was always on what we now call the defensive aspects ofthe company or issue—mainly the assurance that it would con-tinue its dividend unreduced in bad times. Thus the strong rail-570 Appendixesroads, which constituted the standard investment commons of fifty
years ago, were actually regarded in very much the same way as
the public-utility commons in recent years. If the past record indi-
cated stability, the chief requirement was met; not too much effortwas made to anticipate adverse changes of an underlying characterin the future. But, conversely, especially favorable future prospectswere regarded by shrewd investors as something to look for butnot to pay for.
In effect this meant that the investor did not have to pay any-
thing substantial for superior long-term prospects. He got these,virtually without extra cost, as a reward for his own superior intel-
ligence and judgment in picking the best rather than the merely
good companies. For common stocks with the same financialstrength, past earnings record, and dividend stability all sold atabout the same dividend yield.
This was indeed a shortsighted point of view, but it had the
great advantage of making common-stock investment in the old
days not only simple but also basically sound and highly prof-
itable. Let me return for the last time to a personal note. Some-where around 1920 our firm distributed a series of little pamphlets
entitled Lessons for Investors. Of course it took a brash analyst in his
middle twenties like myself to hit on so smug and presumptuous a
title. But in one of the papers I made the casual statement that “if a
common stock is a good investment it is also a good speculation.”
For, reasoned I, if a common stock was so sound that it carried verylittle risk of loss it must ordinarily be so good as to possess excel-
lent chances for future gains. Now this was a perfectly true andeven valuable discovery, but it was true only because nobody paid
any attention to it. Some years later, when the public woke up to
the historical merits of common stocks as long-term investments,
they soon ceased to have any such merit, because the public’senthusiasm created price levels which deprived them of their built-
in margin of safety, and thus drove them out of the investment
class. Then, of course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme,and we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring(in 1931) that no common stock could ever be an investment.
When we view this long-range experience in perspective we
find another set of paradoxes in the investor’s changing attitudetoward capital gains as contrasted with income. It seems a truismAppendixes 571to say that the old-time common-stock investor was not much
interested in capital gains. He bought almost entirely for safety and
income, and let the speculator concern himself with price apprecia-
tion. Today we are likely to say that the more experienced andshrewd the investor, the less attention he pays to dividend returns,and the more heavily his interest centers on long-term apprecia-tion. Yet one might argue, perversely, that precisely because theold-time investor did not concentrate on future capital apprecia-
tion he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he would have it,
at least in the field of industrial stocks. And, conversely, today’sinvestor is so concerned with anticipating the future that he is
already paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has
projected with so much study and care may actually happen andstill not bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to thedegree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporaryand perhaps even permanent loss.
What lessons —again using the pretentious title of my 1920 pam-
phlet—can the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past withcurrent attitudes? Not much of value, one is inclined to say. We canlook back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for
the present and could get the future for nothing—an “all this and
Heaven too” combination. Shaking our heads sadly we mutter,“Those days are gone forever.” Have not investors and security
analysts eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects?
By so doing have they not permanently expelled themselves fromthat Eden where promising common stocks at reasonable prices
could be plucked off the bushes? Are we doomed always to run therisk either of paying unreasonably high prices for good quality and
prospects, or of getting poor quality and prospects when we pay
what seems a reasonable price?
It certainly looks that way. Yet one cannot be sure even of that
pessimistic dilemma. Recently, I did a little research in the long-term history of that towering enterprise, General Electric—stimu-
lated by the arresting chart of fifty-nine years of earnings anddividends appearing in their recently published 1957 Report. Thesefigures are not without their surprises for the knowledgeable ana-lyst. For one thing they show that prior to 1947 the growth of G. E.was fairly modest and quite irregular. The 1946 earnings, per shareadjusted, were only 30 per cent higher than in 1902—52 cents ver-572 Appendixessus 40 cents—and in no year of this period were the 1902 earnings
as much as doubled. Yet the price-earnings ratio rose from 9 times
in 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again in 1946. One might
say, of course, that the 1946 multiplier at least showed the well-known prescience of shrewd investors. We analysts were able toforesee then the really brilliant period of growth that was loomingahead in the next decade. Maybe so. But some of you rememberthat the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high
for G.E.’s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary
fall in the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1split) G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings
and its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings.
Our crystal ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelvemonths.
This striking reversal took place only eleven years ago. It casts
some little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability ofthe popular belief among analysts that prominent and promising
companies will now always sell at high price-earnings ratios—that
this is a fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as wellaccept and like it. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic on this
point. All I can say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of
you must seek to settle it for yourself.
But in my concluding remarks I can say something definite
about the structure of the market for various types of commonstocks, in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics.In the old days the investment character of a common stock was
more or less the same as, or proportionate with, that of the enter-prise itself, as measured quite well by its credit rating. The lower
the yield on its bonds or preferred, the more likely was the com-
mon to meet all the criteria for a satisfactory investment, and the
smaller the element of speculation involved in its purchase. Thisrelationship, between the speculative ranking of the common and
the investment rating of the company, could be graphically
expressed pretty much as a straight line descending from left toright. But nowadays I would describe the graph as U-shaped. Atthe left, where the company itself is speculative and its credit low,the common stock is of course highly speculative, just as it hasalways been in the past. At the right extremity, however, where thecompany has the highest credit rating because both its past recordAppendixes 573and future prospects are most impressive, we find that the stock
market tends more or less continuously to introduce a highly spec-
ulative element into the common shares through the simple means
of a price so high as to carry a fair degree of risk.
At this point I cannot forbear introducing a surprisingly rele-
vant, if quite exaggerated, quotation on the subject which I foundrecently in one of Shakespeare’s sonnets. It reads:
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor
Lose all and more by paying too much rent?
Returning to my imaginary graph, it would be the center area
where the speculative element in common-stock purchases would
tend to reach its minimum. In this area we could find many well-established and strong companies, with a record of past growth
corresponding to that of the national economy and with future
prospects apparently of the same character. Such common stockscould be bought at most times, except in the upper ranges of a bull
market, at moderate prices in relation to their indicated intrinsic
values. As a matter of fact, because of the present tendency ofinvestors and speculators alike to concentrate on more glamorousissues, I should hazard the statement that these middle-groundstocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their independentlydeterminable values. They thus have a margin-of-safety factor sup-
plied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend to
destroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues. Further-more, in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for
penetrating analysis of the past record and for discriminating
choice in the area of future prospects, to which can be added thehigher assurance of safety conferred by diversification.
When Phaëthon insisted on driving the chariot of the Sun, his
father, the experienced operator, gave the neophyte some advicewhich the latter failed to follow—to his cost. Ovid summed up
Phoebus Apollo’s counsel in three words:

I think this principle holds good for investors and their security
analyst advisers.574 Appendixes5. A Case History: Aetna Maintenance Co.
The first part of this history is reproduced from our 1965 edition,
where it appeared under the title “A Horrible Example.” The sec-
ond part summarizes the later metamorphosis of the enterprise.
We think it might have a salutary effect on our readers’ future
attitude toward new common-stock offerings if we cited one “hor-rible example” here in some detail. It is taken from the first page ofStandard & Poor’s Stock Guide, and illustrates in extreme fashion
the glaring weaknesses of the 1960–1962 flotations, the extraordi-
nary overvaluations given them in the market, and the subsequent
collapse.
In November 1961, 154,000 shares of Aetna Maintenance Co.
common were sold to public at $9 and the price promptlyadvanced to $15. Before the financing the net assets per share wereabout $1.20, but they were increased to slightly over $3 per shareby the money received for the new shares.
The sales and earnings prior to the financing were:
The corresponding figures after the financing were:
June 1963 $4,681,000 $ 42,000 (def.) $0.11 (def.)
June 1962 4,234,000 149,000 0.36
In 1962 the price fell to 22⁄3, and in 1964 it sold as low as 7⁄8. No divi-
dends were paid during this period.
COMMENT : This was much too small a business for public partic-
ipation. The stock was sold—and bought—on the basis of one good
year; the results previously had been derisory. There was nothing inAppendixes 575

bility. At the high price soon after issuance the heedless public was
paying much more per dollar of earnings and assets than for most
of our large and strong companies. This example is admittedlyextreme, but it is far from unique; the instances of lesser, but inex-cusable, overvaluations run into the hundreds.
Sequel 1965–1970
In 1965 new interests came into the company. The unprofitable
building-maintenance business was sold out, and the company em-
barked in an entirely different venture: making electronic devices.
The name was changed to Haydon Switch and Instrument Co. Theearnings results have not been impressive. In the five years1965–1969 the enterprise showed average earnings of only 8 centsper share of “old stock,” with 34 cents earned in the best year, 1967.However, in true modern style, the company split the stock 2 for 1 in1968. The market price also ran true to Wall Street form. It advancedfrom 
7⁄8in 1964 to the equivalent of 161⁄2in 1968 (after the split). The
price now exceeded the record set in the enthusiastic days of 1961.
This time the overvaluation was much worse than before. The stock
was now selling at 52 times the earnings of its only good year, andsome 200 times its average earnings. Also, the company was again to
report a deficit in the very year that the new high price was estab-
lished. The next year, 1969, the bid price fell to $1.
Q
UESTIONS : Did the idiots who paid $8+ for this stock in 1968
know anything at all about the company’s previous history, itsfive-year earnings record, its asset value (very small)? Did they
have any idea of how much—or rather how little—they were get-
ting for their money? Did they care? Has anyone on Wall Street anyresponsibility at all for the regular recurrence of completely brain-
less, shockingly widespread, and inevitable catastrophic specula-
tion in this kind of vehicle?
6. Tax Accounting for NVF’s Acquisition of Sharon 
Steel Shares
1. NVF acquired 88% of Sharon stock in 1969, paying for each
share $70 in NVF 5% bonds, due 1994, and warrants to buy 11⁄2576 Appendixesshares of NVF at $22 per share. The initial market value of the
bonds appears to have been only 43% of par, while the warrants
were quoted at $10 per NVF share involved. This meant that the
Sharon holders got only $30 worth of bonds but $15 worth of war-rants for each share turned in, a total of $45 per share. (This wasabout the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing pricefor the year.) The book value of Sharon was $60 per share. The dif-ference between this book value and the market value of Sharon
stock amounted to about $21 million on the 1,415,000 shares of
Sharon acquired.
2. The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three
things: (a)To treat the issuance of the bonds as equivalent to a
“sale” thereof at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from
income for amortization of the huge bond discount of $54 million.
(Actually it would be charging itself about 15% annual interest onthe “proceeds” of the $99 million debenture issue.) (b)To offset this
bond-discount charge by an approximately equal “profit,” consist-
ing of a credit to income of one-tenth of the difference between the
cost price of 45 for the Sharon stock and its book value of 60. (This
would correspond, in reverse fashion, to the required practice of
charging income each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi-
tions in excess of the book value of the assets acquired.) (c)The
beauty of this arrangement would be that the company could saveinitially about $900,000 a year, or $1 per share, in income taxes fromthese two annual entries, because the amortization of bond dis-
count could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization
of “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in tax-able income.
3. This accounting treatment is reflected in both the consoli-
dated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF
for 1969, and pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of
Sharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants, it was nec-essary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part ofthe common-stock capital figure. Thus in this case, as in no otherthat we know, the warrants were assigned a substantial value inthe balance sheet, namely $22 million+ (but only in an explanatorynote).Appendixes 5777. Technological Companies as Investments
In the Standard & Poor’s services in mid-1971 there were listed
about 200 companies with names beginning with Compu-, Data,
Electro-, Scien-, Techno-. About half of these belonged to some partof the computer industry. All of them were traded in the market orhad made applications to sell stock to the public.
A total of 46 such companies appeared in the S & P Stock Guide
for September 1971. Of these, 26 were reporting deficits, only sixwere earning over $1 per share, and only five were paying divi-
dends.
In the December 1968 Stock Guide there had appeared 45 compa-
nies with similar technological names. Tracing the sequel of this
list, as shown in the September 1971 Guide, we find the following
developments:
C
OMMENT : It is virtually certain that the many technological
companies not included in the Guide in 1968 had a poorer subse-
quent record than those that were included; also that the 12 compa-
nies dropped from the list did worse than those that were retained.
The harrowing results shown by these samples are no doubt rea-
sonably indicative of the quality and price history of the entiregroup of “technology” issues. The phenomenal success of IBM and
a few other companies was bound to produce a spate of public
offerings of new issues in their fields, for which large losses werevirtually guaranteed.578 Appendixes

Chapter 2. The Investor and Inflation
1. This was written before President Nixon’s price-and-wage “freeze” in
August 1971, followed by his “Phase 2” system of controls. These
important developments would appear to confirm the viewsexpressed above.
2. The rate earned on the Standard & Poor’s index of 425 industrial
stocks was about 11
1⁄2% on asset value—due in part to the inclusion 
of the large and highly profitable IBM, which is not one of the DJIA30 issues.

cates that the rates charged for residential telephone services
were somewhat less in 1970 than in 1960.

Chapter 3. A Century of Stock-Market History: 
The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972
1. Both Standard & Poor’s and Dow Jones have separate averages for
public utilities and transportation (chiefly railroad) companies. Since
1965 the New York Stock Exchange has computed an index represent-
ing the movement of all its listed common shares.
2. Made by the Center for Research in Security Prices of the University
of Chicago, under a grant from the Charles E. Merrill Foundation.
3. This was first written in early 1971 with the DJIA at 940. The contrary
view held generally on Wall Street was exemplified in a detailed
study which reached a median valuation of 1520 for the DJIA in 1975.
This would correspond to a discounted value of, say, 1200 in mid-1971. In March 1972 the DJIA was again at 940 after an interveningdecline to 798. Again, Graham was right. The “detailed study” he men-
tions was too optimistic by an entire decade: The Dow Jones IndustrialAverage did not close above 1520 until December 13, 1985!
Chapter 4. General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor
1. A higher tax-free yield, with sufficient safety, can be obtained from
certain Industrial Revenue Bonds, a relative newcomer among financial
inventions. They would be of interest particularly to the enterprisinginvestor.
Chapter 5. The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks
1.Practical Formulas for Successful Investing, Wilfred Funk, Inc., 1953.
2. In current mathematical approaches to investment decisions, it has be-
come standard practice to define “risk” in terms of average price varia-tions or “volatility.” See, for example, An Introduction to Risk and Return,
by Richard A. Brealey, The M.I.T. Press, 1969. We find this use of theword “risk” more harmful than useful for sound investment deci-sions—because it places too much emphasis on market fluctuations.
3. All 30 companies in the DJIA met this standard in 1971.580 EndnotesChapter 6. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor:
Negative Approach
1. In 1970 the Milwaukee road reported a large deficit. It suspended
interest payments on its income bonds, and the price of the 5% issue
fell to 10.
2. For example: Cities Service $6 first preferred, not paying dividends,
sold at as low as 15 in 1937 and at 27 in 1943, when the accumulationshad reached $60 per share. In 1947 it was retired by exchange for
$196.50 of 3% debentures for each share, and it sold as high as 186.
3. An elaborate statistical study carried on under the direction of the
National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that such has actu-
ally been the case. Graham is referring to W. Braddock Hickman, 
Corporate Bond Quality and Investor Experience (Princeton University
Press, 1958). Hickman’s book later inspired Michael Milken of DrexelBurnham Lambert to offer massive high-yield financing to companies
with less than sterling credit ratings, helping to ignite the leveraged-
buyout and hostile takeover craze of the late 1980s.
4. A representative sample of 41 such issues taken from Standard &
Poor’s Stock Guide shows that five lost 90% or more of their high
price, 30 lost more than half, and the entire group about two-thirds.The many not listed in the Stock Guide undoubtedly had a larger
shrinkage on the whole.
Chapter 7. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: 
The Positive Side
1. See, for example, Lucile Tomlinson, Practical Formulas for Successful
Investing; and Sidney Cottle and W. T. Whitman, Investment Timing:
The Formula Approach, both published in 1953.
2. A company with an ordinary record cannot, without confusing the
term, be called a growth company or a “growth stock” merely
because its proponent expects it to do better than the average in the
future. It is just a “promising company.” Graham is making a subtle but
important point: If the definition of a growth stock is a company that will
thrive in the future, then that’s not a definition at all, but wishful thinking.It’s like calling a sports team “the champions” before the season is over.This wishful thinking persists today; among mutual funds, “growth” port-folios describe their holdings as companies with “above-average growthEndnotes 581potential” or “favorable prospects for earnings growth. ” A better defini-
tion might be companies whose net earnings per share have increased
by an annual average of at least 15% for at least five years running.
(Meeting this definition in the past does not ensure that a company willmeet it in the future.)
3. See Table 7-1.
4. Here are two age-old Wall Street proverbs that counsel such sales:
“No tree grows to Heaven” and “A bull may make money, a bear may
make money, but a hog never makes money.”
5. Two studies are available. The first, made by H. G. Schneider, one of
our students, covers the years 1917–1950 and was published in June1951 in the Journal of Finance. The second was made by Drexel Fire-
stone, members of the New York Stock Exchange, and covers theyears 1933–1969. The data are given here by their kind permission.
6. See pp. 393–395, for three examples of special situations existing in
1971.
Chapter 8. The Investor and Market Fluctuations
1. Except, perhaps, in dollar-cost averaging plans begun at a reasonable
price level.
2. But according to Robert M. Ross, authority on the Dow theory, the
last two buy signals, shown in December 1966 and December 1970,were well below the preceding selling points.
3. The top three ratings for bonds and preferred stocks are Aaa, Aa, and
A, used by Moody’s, and AAA, AA, A by Standard & Poor’s. Thereare others, going down to D.
4. This idea has already had some adoptions in Europe—e.g., by the
state-owned Italian electric-energy concern on its “guaranteed float-ing rate loan notes,” due 1980. In June 1971 it advertised in New Yorkthat the annual rate of interest paid thereon for the next six months
would be 8
1⁄8%.
One such flexible arrangement was incorporated in The Toronto-
Dominion Bank’s “7%–8% debentures,” due 1991, offered in June
1971. The bonds pay 7% to July 1976 and 8% thereafter, but the holderhas the option to receive his principal in July 1976.582 EndnotesChapter 9. Investing in Investment Funds
1. The sales charge is universally stated as a percentage of the selling
price, which includes the charge, making it appear lower than if
applied to net asset value. We consider this a sales gimmick unwor-
thy of this respectable industry.

4. Title of a book first published in 1852. The volume described the
“South Sea Bubble,” the tulip mania, and other speculative binges ofthe past. It was reprinted by Bernard M. Baruch, perhaps the only
continuously successful speculator of recent times, in 1932. Comment:
That was locking the stable door after the horse was stolen. Charles
Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds
(Metro Books, New York, 2002) was first published in 1841. Neither a
light read nor always strictly accurate, it is an extensive look at how large numbers of people often believe very silly things—for instance, that
iron can be transmuted into gold, that demons most often show up on
Friday evenings, and that it is possible to get rich quick in the stock market. For a more factual account, consult Edward Chancellor’s Devil
Take the Hindmost (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, New York, 1999); for a
lighter take, try Robert Menschel’s Markets, Mobs, and Mayhem: A 
Modern Look at the Madness of Crowds (John Wiley & Sons, New 
York, 2002).
Chapter 10. The Investor and His Advisers
1. The examinations are given by the Institute of Chartered Financial
Analysts, which is an arm of the Financial Analysts Federation. Thelatter now embraces constituent societies with over 50,000 members.
2. The NYSE had imposed some drastic rules of valuation (known as
“haircuts”) designed to minimize this danger, but apparently theydid not help sufficiently.
3. New offerings may now be sold only by means of a prospectus pre-
pared under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.This document must disclose all the pertinent facts about the issueand issuer, and it is fully adequate to inform the prudent investor as to
the exact nature of the security offered him. But the very copiousnessEndnotes 583of the data required usually makes the prospectus of prohibitive
length. It is generally agreed that only a small percentage of individu-
alsbuying new issues read the prospectus with thoroughness. Thus
they are still acting mainly not on their own judgment but on that ofthe house selling them the security or on the recommendation of theindividual salesman or account executive.
Chapter 11. Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: 
General Approach
1. Our textbook, Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd,
Sidney Cottle, and Charles Tatham (McGraw-Hill, 4th ed., 1962),
retains the title originally chosen in 1934, but it covers much of the
scope of financial analysis.
2. With Charles McGolrick, Harper & Row, 1964, reissued by Harper-
Business, 1998.
3. These figures are from Salomon Bros., a large New York bond house.
4. At least not by the great body of security analysts and investors.
Exceptional analysts, who can tell in advance what companies are
likely to deserve intensive study and have the facilities and capability
to make it, may have continued success with this work. For details ofsuch an approach see Philip Fisher, Common Stocks and Uncommon
Profits, Harper & Row, 1960.
5. On p. 295 we set forth a formula relating multipliers to the rate of
expected growth.
6. Part of the fireworks in the price of Chrysler was undoubtedly
inspired by two two-for-one stock splits taking place in the singleyear 1963—an unprecedented phenomenon for a major company. In
the early 1980s, under Lee Iacocca, Chrysler did a three-peat, coming
back from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the best-performing
stocks in America. However, identifying managers who can lead greatcorporate comebacks is not as easy as it seems. When Al Dunlap took
over Sunbeam Corp. in 1996 after restructuring Scott Paper Co. (and
driving its stock price up 225% in 18 months), Wall Street hailed him aslittle short of the Second Coming. Dunlap turned out to be a sham whoused improper accounting and false financial statements to misleadSunbeam’s investors—including the revered money managers MichaelPrice and Michael Steinhardt, who had hired him. For a keen dissectionof Dunlap’s career, see John A. Byrne, Chainsaw (HarperCollins, New
York, 1999).584 Endnotes7. Note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the “true value”
of a growth stock, but only that it approximates the results of the
more elaborate calculations in vogue.
Chapter 12. Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings
1. Our recommended method of dealing with the warrant dilution is
discussed below. We prefer to consider the market value of the war-rants as an addition to the current market price of the common stock
as a whole.
Chapter 13. A Comparison of Four Listed Companies
1. In March 1972, Emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings!
Chapter 14. Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor
1. Because of numerous stock splits, etc., through the years, the actual
average price of the DJIA list was about $53 per share in early 1972.
2. In 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show current
assets equal to twice current liabilities, and only two failed to have
net current assets exceeding their debt. By December 1970 the num-ber in each category had grown from two to twelve.
3. But note that their combined market action from December 1970 to
early 1972 was poorer than that of the DJIA. This demonstrates onceagain that no system or formula will guarantee superior market
results. Our requirements “guarantee” only that the portfolio-buyer is
getting his money’s worth.
4. As a consequence we must exclude the majority of gas pipeline
stocks, since these enterprises are heavily bonded. The justificationfor this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which“guarantee” bond payments; but the considerations here may be too
complicated for the needs of a defensive investor.
Chapter 15. Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor
1.Mutual Funds and Other Institutional Investors: A New Perspective,
I. Friend, M. Blume, and J. Crockett, McGraw-Hill, 1970. We shouldadd that the 1966–1970 results of many of the funds we studied wereEndnotes 585somewhat better than those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock com-
posite and considerably better than those of the DJIA.
2. Personal note: Many years before the stock-market pyrotechnics in
that particular company the author was its “financial vice-president”at the princely salary of $3,000 per annum. It was then really in thefireworks business. In early 1929, Graham became a financial vice pres-
ident of Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., the nation’s largest producer offireworks. Unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company andno longer exists in independent form.
3. The Guide does not show multipliers above 99. Most such would be
mathematical oddities, caused by earnings just above the zero point.
Chapter 16. Convertible Issues and Warrants
1. This point is well illustrated by an offering of two issues of Ford
Motor Finance Co. made simultaneously in November 1971. One wasa 20-year nonconvertible bond, yielding 7
1⁄2%. The other was a 25-year
bond, subordinated to the first in order of claim and yielding only4
1⁄2%; but it was made convertible into Ford Motor stock, against its
then price of 681⁄2.To obtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave
up 40% of income and accepted a junior-creditor position.
2. Note that in late 1971 Studebaker-Worthington common sold as low
as 38 while the $5 preferred sold at or about 77. The spread had thusgrown from 2 to 20 points during the year, illustrating once more thedesirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock mar-
ket to neglect arithmetic. (Incidentally the small premium of the pre-
ferred over the common in December 1970 had already been made upby its higher dividend.)
Chapter 17. Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories
1. See, for example, the article “Six Flags at Half Mast,” by Dr. A. J.
Briloff, in Barron’s, January 11, 1971.
Chapter 18. A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies
1. The reader will recall from p. 434 above that AAA Enterprises tried to
enter this business, but quickly failed. Here Graham is making a pro-586 Endnotesfound and paradoxical observation: The more money a company makes,
the more likely it is to face new competition, since its high returns signal
so clearly that easy money is to be had. The new competition, in turn, will
lead to lower prices and smaller profits. This crucial point was over-looked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed that earlywinners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.
Chapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy
1. Analytical studies have shown that in the typical case a dollar paid
out in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar-
ket price as had a dollar of undistributed earnings. This point was
well illustrated by the public-utility group for a number of yearsbefore 1950. The low-payout issues sold at low multipliers of earn-ings, and proved to be especially attractive buys because their divi-
dends were later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much
more uniform for the industry.
Chapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept 
of Investment
1. This argument is supported by Paul Hallingby, Jr., “Speculative
Opportunities in Stock-Purchase Warrants,” Analysts’ Journal, third
quarter 1947.
Postscript
1. Veracity requires the admission that the deal almost fell through
because the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would
be 100% covered by asset value. A future $300 million or more in mar-
ket gain turned on, say, $50,000 of accounting items. By dumb luckthey got what they insisted on.
